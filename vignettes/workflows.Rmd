The `rt` package was built to make it easier for our team to work with RT in an automated fashion..
As a result, most functions in the package return something suitable for programming further with.
Below are some example workflows you might use this package for.


## Creating tickets

You can always email your RT installations associated email address to create a ticket but you can also create one programmatically:

```
rt_ticket_create("General", "me@example.com", "Hey, a quick question...")
```

You could also create a set of tickets from a database dump of some kind, such as an old ticket tracking system.

First, let's create some example data to work with:

```r
old_tickets <- data.frame(
  queue = "General",
  subject = c("I need some help", "about those TPS reports...", "hello!"),
  requestor = c("someone@example.com", "boss@initech.com", "user@example.com"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

With some example data, creating tickets for each of those in on go is only a few lines of code:

```r
lapply(seq_len(nrow(old_tickets)), function (row) {
  do.call(rt_ticket_create, as.list(old_tickets[row,]))
})
```

TODO

- Edit a ticket
    - Set a ticket's status to Resolved
    - Reassign tickets from one person to another
- Comment and reply to tickets
- View all unassigned tickets
