# rt

An interface to the [RequestTracker API](https://rt-wiki.bestpractical.com/wiki/REST).

## Installation

```r
install.packages("rt")
```

## Usage

### Setup

To start using the `rt` package, log in to your RT instance by setting the server URL in using `Sys.setenv` and use `rt_login()` to log in and store your session locally.

Below, we log into Best Practical's demo installation of RT:

```r
library(rt)

Sys.setenv("RT_BASE_URL" = "https://demo.bestpractical.com")
rt_login() # Enter demo/demo
```

Once you are successfully logged in, you're all set to use the package.
The `rt` package supports all of the [RequestTracker REST API](https://rt-wiki.bestpractical.com/wiki/REST):

- General
  - Login: `rt_login()`
  - Logout: `rt_logout()`
- Tickets
  - Ticket Properties: `rt_ticket_properties()`
  - Ticket Links: `rt_ticket_links()`
  - Ticket Attachments: `rt_ticket_attachments()`
  - Ticket Attachment: `rt_ticket_attachment()`
  - Ticket Attachment Content: `rt_ticket_attachment_content()`
  - Ticket History: `rt_ticket_history()`
  - Ticket History Entry: `rt_ticket_history_entry()`
  - Ticket Search: `rt_ticket_search()`
  - Ticket Create: `rt_ticket_create()`
  - Ticket Edit: `rt_ticket_edit()`
  - Tickets History Reply: `rt_ticket_history_reply()`
  - Ticket History Comment: `rt_ticket_history_comment()`
  - Ticket Links Edit: `rt_ticket_links_edit()`
- Users
  - User Properties: `rt_user_properties()`
  - User Create: `rt_user_create()`
  - User Edit: `rt_user_edit()`
- Queues
  - Queue Properties: `rt_queue_properties()`

Note: Most of these functions support being chained together (for example, with the `%>%`).

See the included vignettes for more information about usage.

### Logging out

To log out, use the `rt_logout` function (or restart your R session):

```r
rt_logout()
```

## Development & Testing

A test suite is provided that is comprised mostly of integration tests that are configured to run against a local installation of RT.
By default, running `devtools::test()` will only run a small subset of the full test suite: those that do not depend on being able to call out to an RT installation (i.e., unit tests).

To run the full test suite locally,

1. Start a local RT installation with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/):

    ```sh
    docker run -d --name rt -p 80:80 netsandbox/request-tracker
    ```

2. Turn on integration tests for your session

    ```r
    Sys.setenv("RT_INTEGRATION" = TRUE)
    ```

3. Run `devtools::test()` from the same session as (2)

### `rt_api` objects

All API calls go through an intermediate state as an `rt_api` object, which is made up of three parts:

1. the `content`, generally returned as a tibble/data frame
2. the `path` or URL that was accessed
3. the HTTP `response` from the API.

This is mainly to help normalize out some of the inconsistencies in the RT API itself and make implementing the API call wrappers easier.
